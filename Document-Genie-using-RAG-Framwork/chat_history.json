        "response": "Most scientists agree that the Southeast Asian Red Junglefowl (\ngallus gallus) \nis the primary wild ancestor of chickens. However, because DNA studies show that the Red Junglefowl lacks the gene for yellow skin (and shanks) it is believed that some point, hybridization with the Grey Junglefowl (\nGallus sonnaratii\n) of India has occurred. The body structure of the Indian Gamebird (Cornish) and the Brahmas of China gives physical evidence of Grey Jungle- fowl influence. The tail carriage of the breed Sumatra indicates genetic contributions of the SriLanka Junglefowl (\nGallus lafayetti\n). No doubt the Green Junglefowl (\nGallus varius\n) has also contributed to modern chickens."
